# tic-tac-toe

This is a web based Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns placing their markers ('X' or 'O) on a 3x3 grid. The game should track each player's moves and determine when a player has won (three marks in a row) or if the game results in a tie

The purpose of this project was to practice using factory functions and the module pattern. After completing this project I have learned how to organize my code by separating state logic from DOM logic.
